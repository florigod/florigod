# 👋 Hi, I'm Florian Mathe

## About Me
Backend developer in training with a passion for clean, efficient code and scalable systems.

## Current Project
#### I'm currently working on:
Just finished a project and I'm planning on my next move.


## Previous Projects

#### RainCast Notifier
An automated "set-and-forget" weather system designed to eliminate manual forecast checking by analyzing data daily and alerting users only when necessary.

Engineered a hybrid email architecture (SendGrid + SMTP) to overcome cloud port restrictions and ensure high deliverability.

Implemented serverless scheduling using GitHub Actions to trigger daily background analysis of Open-Meteo API data.

Developed a Django backend that generates dynamic, in-memory Matplotlib charts to visualize rain intensity in emails.


### SQL practice with IMDb database
Cleaned, normalized, and indexed datasets to improve performance and integrity.

Practiced schema design, constraints, and query optimization.

Gained hands-on experience with schema design and query efficiency.


### Tasks REST API with OAuth2
CRUD operations for tasks linked to user accounts.

Authentication-based REST API using FastAPI, JWT tokens, and PostgreSQL.  

Command Line Interface for tasks and user management 


### Game Development Portfolio
C++, C# and GDScript projects built in Unity, Unreal and Godot — exploring game systems, OOP, and design patterns. I intend to follow a Game-dev journey, as well as my Backend programming one, trying to balance both equally.
